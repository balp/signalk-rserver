Signal-K RServer
================

This is a alternative server implementations for the signalk protocol.


Looking into the npm signalk server it's combinging may different applications
using pluging into a single npm web-application. I think a more mudular micro-service
archtiecture whould fir the application on my boat better.

Lets code and see if I got that right.
